# TEDx Web Recruitment Task
This is my recruitment task for the TEDx NITK. I have chosen the Talk Archive page to modify. I tried to make the page more visually appealing while maintaining the overall theme of the whole website. I added some more features and different components to the page which I found more user interactive and appealing. The code has been uploaded in the master branch.
